## Description
With the goal of being able to generate and simple logo for my projects, I created a command line SVG logo maker. After running node index.js in the terminal, the user will be prompted to choose up to 3 letters of text, the text color, the logo shape, and logo color. Once complete, the logo will be generated and shown as a 300x200 pixel image.
